Why conditionals? Conditional statements are boolen statements helping us to check some given conditions and act accordingly. For example, if statement a is true, then perform b.\n","\n","On the other hand, for and while statements helps us to do the repetitive statements in an efficient way. If we want to do the same repetitive task over and over by using values similar to each other (e.g., addition of a set of numbers), we could use a for (or while) statement instead of doing the same thing over an over. By doing this, we write a cleaner code while saving ourselves a lot of time.\n","\n","Here is the related documentation about these: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tRH9UD8ueY0m","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## If statements\n","\n","If statements are used to check conditional arguments. Checking a condition means using comparison operators to find out if the statement is True or False. So, we use ==, !=, <, <=, > and >= to check whether a statement is True or False (Please refer to Part 1 for the comparison operators). Here is how it works: The if statement, checks the first condition; if it is True, it will give you that output. If not True, it goes to the second condition. Since we already used one if, the second condition must be written with elif (shortcut for else if). If the second one is True, that will produce the output. If that is also not True, it will check the next statement.\n","\n","We write the last statement with else. This is optional. Note that else statement doesn't have any conditional argument. This means if all other conditions are not satisfied, this is what you want your computer to do. \n","\n","Practice these below with the following codes. Each time, I changed the value of apples so that it prints a different portion of the code.\n","\n","Indentation is very important when writing these statements. It is 4 spaces from left. Also, don't forget semicolon : at the end of each statement.
